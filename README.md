# Pacman-Exercise
The goal of this exercise was to generate Pacmen which would cycle through images to create a chomping effect as well as be able to detect collisions to allow for a change in direction.

# Installation
In order to view this demonstration, you will need to "Fork" a copy of this repository you your GitHub.  Once you have done that you can "Clone" a copy of the repository to your local computer.  When you have the files locally, you can open the index.html and begin using the program.

# How To Use
There are three buttons at the top of the screen. Clicking "Add PacMan" will add one Pacman to the screen for each click.  By pressing "Start Game" you will cause the Pacmen to begin to move around the screen.  Each pacman will travel until it collides with the edge of the screen and then it will bounce off in another direction.  To clear the screen you may click the "Reset Game" button.

# Roadmap
I would like to stylize the game to add a more interesting background and borders.  I would also like to implement the ability to the Pacmen's shape to change when hitting colliding with the borders like a ball would compress when hitting an object in real life.
